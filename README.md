# AlphaBeta Chess Minimax from scratch
Utilizes bitboards as backing storage, and efficiency is maintained up to a ply of 7. Further improvements are expected to increase it's accuracy and efficiency, although most upgrades will likely be tabled after some necessary refactoring.

All code is original and my own work, include the PGN notation conversion (still needs some edge case improvement). Regardless, I am happy with the state the project is in, and will feel content once mostly every edge case has been addressed. 

## Still in progress!

### Primary objectives
- Prevent end game from breaking the algorithm and allow the path to be taken.
- Allowing user input for castling and pawn promotion
- Configured OTU for proper ambiguity and expected FIDE notation.
